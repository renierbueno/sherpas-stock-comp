# 03 · Decision log

Every decision in the case: what, why, date, who confirmed. Newest at the bottom. A decision is changed by a new entry that supersedes the old one, never by editing it.

## D-001 · The harness is adapted from existing skills, not written from scratch
- What: the skills in `.claude/skills/` are copied and edited from product-sdd and a private derivative of it (my own spec-driven harnesses) for structure, checkpoints, evidence labels and "done when" criteria, and from jinjin1's Cursor-for-Product-Managers (Apache-2.0, credited in `NOTICE`, license in `third_party/`) for output formats only (interview snapshots, ICE, one-pager). Anything not relevant to this case is cut.
- Why: proven skills, edited for the case, are faster and more reliable than new ones; owning and editing them is the documented best practice for Claude Code skills.

## D-002 · Each skill is written just before its phase
- What: F0 writes only `setup-case`, `capture-platform`, `research` and `/check`. Each later skill (discovery, decide, assumptions, spec, prototype) is written right before its phase, with a dry run that shows its output file. A skill that does not pass its dry run within the timebox is used as is, and the debt is logged here.
- Why: build by need and test before writing more, instead of configuring everything up front.

## D-003 · Markdown in the repo is the source of truth; Notion and Miro are published at every closed gate
- What: Miro is the working board (messy is fine). Notion holds only clean content, updated at every closed gate. Each publish needs Renier's OK at that moment.
- Why: both workspaces belong to Sherpas and changes are visible in real time; the brief offers them to think and to show how we think, so waiting until the last day would waste them.

## D-004 · Two connected deliverables: proposal + EARS spec, and a pull request
- What: (1) the proposal and the EARS spec in Notion (the definition); (2) a pull request in this repo implementing the MVP in the prototype (input, model, score simulator, analysis view), with each acceptance criterion linked to its test, tests green, and screenshots or a deploy (decided in F5). The spec drives the PR; the PR validates the spec; gaps found go back to the spec and to this log. The PR is a reference implementation: engineering decides how to build it in production. The proposal answers the brief's four questions plus what stays out and why.
- Why: a spec says what to build; a working implementation shows the spec holds up and is precise enough to build from.
- Date: 2026-10-03 · Confirmed by: Renier

## D-005 · Language
- What: repo, docs, skills, outputs and deliverables in English. The brief stays in its original language.
- Why: the product and its users are in the US and the video is in English.
- Date: 2026-10-03 · Confirmed by: Renier

## D-006 · The brief is kept as received
- What: `00_brief.md` keeps the brief, the email and the score article as received, with no translation. Only credentials and private links are redacted.
- Why: it is the source; a translation would be a second version to keep in sync.
- Date: 2026-10-03 · Confirmed by: Renier

## D-007 · Questionnaire: capture every step, never submit
- What: moving between steps is allowed, with every click asked through the "ask" permission. Submitting or the last step: never by Claude. Renier decides at the end of F1 whether to submit; if so, he does it himself with a realistic profile that includes RSUs.
- Why: the link is single-use; the information cannot be recovered after submitting.
- Date: 2026-10-03 · Confirmed by: Renier

## D-008 · A prototype that imitates the Sherpas interface is always password-protected if deployed
- What: whether to deploy (versus repo or video only) is decided in F5; if deployed and it imitates their UI, it sits behind a password.
- Why: everything seen on the platform is confidential [brief].
- Date: 2026-10-03 · Confirmed by: Renier

## D-009 · Git history is part of the delivery
- What: on main, one commit per closed gate with a message that explains why. The PR lives on its own branch with small commits tied to acceptance criteria and is merged to main when F5 closes. No "wip" commits anywhere. The remote is private on GitHub and will be shared with Sherpas. Push only with Renier's OK.
- Why: the history shows how the work was done, which the brief asks to see.
- Date: 2026-10-03 · Confirmed by: Renier

## D-010 · Confidentiality is enforced by hooks and permissions, not by prose
- What: a pre-commit hook blocks the original brief files, platform captures, screenshots outside `prototype/`, the demo user and password, one-use links and auth tokens. Bypassing it (`--no-verify`) and changing `core.hooksPath` are denied in `.claude/settings.json`. Chrome clicks and page writes need an "ask" approval. Raw captures live in `captures/`, outside git. The prototype uses our own code that imitates the design; their JavaScript and source are never copied.
- Why: a rule that must always hold should be a hook, not a request. Tested on 2026-10-03 in a throwaway repo: 7 bad commits blocked, 2 good ones passed.
